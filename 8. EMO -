PG 2 LYRIC

You are not the only woman that I want
You are one of many that I see
You are not the only woman that I need
You are one of many that I know 

I know my life is a little fucked up
Because I don't commit to I want to fuck them all
I coul'dve commit to fucked them all
Why won't I break her/my heart

Hey you hey aren't you that little boy
My father
I hate you for not banging making noise
My mother 
Has been waiting for a simple man like you.
It's over 
it's over it's over for her and you

Hey you hey aren't you that old little girl
Who hates me for dating other girls
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry to end my world
Before I ever I ever I ever talk to you

Stay with me my old little girl
Stay with me my hoe woman girl
Stay with me in this old lonely world
Stay with me 4x

Blaze blaze blaze with me 
Crave crave cravin' me
Scratchin' scratchin' scratchin' me
Sleep sleep sleep with me
