PG 2 LYRIC

You are not the only woman that I want
You are not the only woman that I need
You are one of many that I see
You are one of many that I think of 

I know my life is a little fucked up
Because I don't admit I want to fuck them all
I coul'dve just fucked them all
Why won't I break her/my heart

Hey you hey aren't you that little boy
My father
I hate you for not making noise
My mother 
Has been waiting for a simple man like you.
It's over it's over it's over for me and you

Hey you hey aren't you that old little girl
Who hates me for dating other girls
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry to end my world
Is over it's over it's over for me and you.
All sad bro.
I'm sorry 

Hate you not remember my voice
Mother is 
Damaged damaged damaged


You are not the only woman that I need
