PG 2 LYRIC

The outfit that she wears
The colours of her eyes
The colours in her hair
The dirty everywhere

The glasses that she wears
The evil way that she stares
Will you take off all your clothes
Won't you be in my world 

Baby
Sometimes I don't know
What I want to do
Baby
Sometimes I don't go
Where I want to go
I
Rather be alone
Rather be at home with you

Stupid little boy (Slap)
Wan't you be my toy (insert moan)
Want you mate my noise okay girl whatever you say girl)

We fuck we fuck we fuck on the floor
She uh uh and uh up for more
It's love it's love yeah so


Sometimes all I wamt
Never be alone 

I'm damaged I'm damged I'm damaged I'm no-ne.

Who I want to bone
Forever till the moarn 
Forever hear her moan
