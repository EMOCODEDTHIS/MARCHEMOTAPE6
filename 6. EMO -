PG 2 LYRIC

The outfit that she wears
The colours of her eyes
The colour in her hair
My dirty everywhere

The glasses that she wears (muah)
The evil way that she stares (ou damn girl)
Will you take off all your clothes (take it all off)
Won't you be in my world (Lets make our own world)

Baby 
Sometimes I don't know (What don't you know girl)
What I want to do (What do you want to do girl)
Baby
Sometimes I don't know (Girl what don't you know girl)
Where I want to go (What the fuuck do you mean girl)
I want to be with you and you don't want to be with me (Who are you girl)

Stupid little boy (Slap)
Wan't you be my toy (insert moan)
Want you mate my noise okay girl whatever you say girl)

We fuck we fuck we fuck on the floor
She uh uh and uh up for more
It's love it's love yeah so
We fuck we fuck some more

Sometimes all I wamt
Never be alone 

I'm damaged I'm damged I'm damaged I'm no-ne.

Who I want to bone
Forever till the moarn 
Forever hear her moan
