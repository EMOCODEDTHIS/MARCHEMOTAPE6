PG 2 LYRIC

The outfit that she wears
The colours of her eyes
The colours in her hair
The dirty everywhere

The glasses that she wears
The evil way that she stares
Like take off all your clothes
Won't you be in my world 

Baby
Sometimes I don't know
What I want to do
Baby
Sometimes I don't go
Where I want to go
I
Rather be alone
Rather be at home with you

Stupid little boy
Wan't you be my toy 
(insert moan)
Want you mate my noise
(okay girl)
Whatever you say girl 
Fuck you
Fuck you
I hate you
I dated you
I dated you  


Sometimes I want to go
Some place all alomne

Who I want to bone
Forever till the moarn 
Forever hear her moan
