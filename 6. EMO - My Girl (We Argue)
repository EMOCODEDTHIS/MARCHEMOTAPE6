The outfit that she wears (Oh my gaw)
The colours of her eyes (Blazed What a princess) 
The colour in her hair (Sh)
My dirty everywhere (My dirty John)

The glasses that she wears (take them off)
The evil way that she stares (ou damn girl)
Will you take off all your clothes (take it all off )
Won't you be in my world (Lets make our own world girl)

Baby 
Sometimes I don't know (What don't you know girl)
What I want to do (What do you want to do girl)
Baby
Sometimes I don't know (Girl what don't you know girl)
Where I want to go (What the fuuck do you mean girl)
I want to be with you (oh yuo want to be with me)
and you don't want to be with me (Who are you girl)

Stupid little boy (Slap)
Wan't you be my toy (insert moan)
Want you mate my noise okay girl whatever you say girl)

We fuck we fuck we fuck on the floor
She uh uh and uh up for more
It's love it's love yeah so

Sometimes all I want to be alone 
I'm damaged I'm damged I'm damaged for a hoe 
I'm no-ne I'm no-ne I'm no-ne I'm no-ne I'm no oone's
I'm someone I'm someone I'm someone I'm someone's
She's a nobody bro

You're know one

You're know one for all
You're peace out
You're tits out
You're legs spread for them all.

I'm gone I'm gone I'm gone 
(Later girl)
